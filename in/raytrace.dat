This is the input parameter data file for the RAYTRACE program in
	ZEPHYRUS.  Please do not remove the "at-sign" at the end of the comments.

	The first set of parameters involves the source;
	the following line should contain the source direction in degrees,
		the source altitude in meters,
		the initial source location (x and y components in meters), and
		the source Mach speed.
	Note that in the presence of wind the source direction is the actual
	ground heading, but the source Mach speed is with respect to the air
	at rest.
